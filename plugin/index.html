But then your family betrayed you, accused you of crimes you didn’t commit. Exiled, you're desperate to clear your name and tame the raging fires within. The world is hostile; its inhabitants inferior, but no one can stop your march to vindication and the reclamation of your throne.</p></div>
		<div class="char2"><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5790d10220099e0a9818daf3/t/580f52a12e69cf6ad14ae05d/1477399223537/Ifan-Abstract-FA-A3_B_1024x768.png" alt=""><p>Nobody leaves the Lone Wolves… You are the peerless assassin Ifan ben-Mezd. You tried to escape the infamous outlaw gang, but your freedom was won at a terrible cost: your ex-comrades found you and slaughtered your family in revenge. Now, languishing in the Sourcerer's ghetto of Fort Joy and addicted to drudanae, you scheme escape again. But this time, you travel a path marked vengeance...</p></div>

Spy, assassin: these are your trades. Not because you wanted them, but because they were forced upon you. Slave to a lizard master who controlled you with a living scar, you lived a life no elf should live - until you cut out your master's tongue, then burned him. Now you're free, but you bear your scar still. You have sworn to free all those who bear the same.</p></div>

You had peace at last, and you were devoted to your savior... until his death left you again susceptible to demonic horrors. Now, something is growing deep within. You're losing time to it; you're losing consciousness. If you can't free yourself soon, you may be lost for good.</p></div>
